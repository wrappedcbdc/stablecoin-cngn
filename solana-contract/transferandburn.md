- Simplifying the Logic Flow: 

The biggest problem is with the burning mechanism. As currently implemented in ERC20, this is unlikely to work in practice on solana because:

Token accounts in Solana belong to their owners, and by default, only the owner can authorize a burn
The recipient would need to have explicitly delegated burn authority to the token_config PDA

In the special case (external whitelisted sender â†’ internal whitelisted recipient), we simply burn the tokens from the sender's account instead of trying to transfer and then burn from the recipient.
