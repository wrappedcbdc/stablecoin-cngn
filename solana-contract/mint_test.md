### MINTING TEST 

#### This comprehensive test suite covers all the important security aspects of your minting functionality. Here's what I've included:

**Basic Functionality Tests:**

- Initializing all required accounts
- Adding users to can-mint list with specific amounts
- Successfully minting tokens
- Verifying users are removed from can-mint list after minting


**Security Tests:**

- Unauthorized minting attempts
- Minting with incorrect amounts
- Minting when blacklisted (both as signer and receiver)
- Minting when paused/unpaused
- Account constraint validations


**Important Edge Cases:**

- Validation of token-config constraints
- Attempted mint-key mismatches
- Testing pause/unpause functionality
- Verifying that users are properly removed from can-mint list



**The tests use multiple user accounts with different roles:**

- Regular authorized users
- Malicious users (added to blacklist)
- Unauthorized users
- Blacklisted recipients

**This thorough test coverage ensures your minting logic is both functionally correct and secure against potential attacks. The test verifies all the key security checks in your mint handler:**

- Blacklist checks for both signer and receiver
- Authorization checks (can_mint)
- Amount validation
- Pausing functionality
- Account constraint validations
- Token config and mint key validations
